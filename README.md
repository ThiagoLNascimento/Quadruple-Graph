Algorithm to generate the Quadruple Graph based on 3 different genomas, returning all optimal solutions for the median problem.

This algorithm has the file "input.txt" as input. The file must be organized with 4 lines. The first line with the number of genes and the following 3 lines with each genoma, where in each genoma, each gene must be separated by a space. Note that the genoma can have more than one cromossome.
